"""Internal feature reference utilities for data processors.

This submodule provides essential components like FeatureRef, InputRefs, and OutputRefs,
which are required for implementing new data processors within the framework. 

While these utilities are crucial for processor development, they are not intended for
direct use by end users interacting with the high-level data flow interface.
