This module provides the essential components for managing the data flow and feature
references within data processing pipelines. It includes functionality for defining
and handling the flow of data through various processing nodes, as well as managing
the references to specific data features within the pipeline.

Key Features:
    - **Data Flow Management**: Defines and manages the flow of data through different
      nodes in a data processing pipeline, ensuring that data is correctly routed and
      processed in the desired sequence.
    - **Feature Reference Handling**: Provides a robust system for referencing specific
      data features within the pipeline. This allows for easy access and manipulation
      of data features, facilitating complex data transformations and analysis.
