"""Module containing processor implementations of all standard unary operators.

This module defines various processors for standard unary operations, such as
negation and logical not. Each processor applies a specific unary operation to
an input feature and produces an output feature based on the operation's result.

The module is structured around a few key components:

- :class:`UnaryOpInputRefs`: Defines the input references for unary operations. 
  Each unary operation takes one input feature, `a`.

- :class:`UnaryOpOutputRefs`: Defines the output references for unary operations. 
  The result of the operation is stored in the `result` attribute.

- :class:`UnaryOpConfig`: Configuration class for unary operations. 
  It specifies the operation to be applied through the `op` attribute.

- :class:`UnaryOp`: Base class for all unary operation processors. 
  It provides the `batch_process` method to apply the operation to batches of data.

Specific subclasses of :class:`UnaryOp` implement various types of operations:

- :class:`UnaryMathOp`: Base class for mathematical unary operations, such as negation.
- :class:`UnaryLogicalOp`: Base class for logical unary operations, such as logical not.
